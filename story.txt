I plan to go to Berlin between my session A and B. 
To get there I will first buy a ticket and go to the Flughafen.
I've been told to try Bratwurst on my firts day there.
As we eat our Bratwurst we could listen to some Rammstein.
After finishing our Bratwurst, we wander down the Hauptstrasse.
Once on the Hauptstrasse, we eat Apfelkuchen.
Our stomaches full, on our way back to Raesfeld we spot a Hund, stopping to give pets.
It seemed hungry so we took it to Doner, a popular fast food place down the street.
We wondered if we should have gotten some Lederhose on the way.
We knew that Reasfeld would be a nice place to visit.
