I plan to go to Berlin between my session A and B. 
To get there I will first buy a ticket and go to the Flughafen.
I've been told to try Bratwurst on my firts day there.
As we eat our Bratwurst we could listen to some Rammstein.
After finishing our Bratwurst, we wander down the Hauptstrasse.
Once on the Hauptstrasse, we eat Apfelkuchen.
Our stomaches full, on our way back to Raesfeld we spot a Hund, stopping to give pets.
It seemed hungry so we took it to Doner, a popular fast food place down the street.
After giving the Hund a piece of my Bratwurst, it welcomed me to its pack and started following us everywhere.
When we finally returned to Raesfeld, the Hund followed us into out Porsche nearby, and we drove off into the sunset.
We wondered if we should have gotten some Lederhose on the way.
We knew that Reasfeld would be a nice place to visit.
Back in Raesfeld, we decided to end the day at the Biergarten, and drink beer.
